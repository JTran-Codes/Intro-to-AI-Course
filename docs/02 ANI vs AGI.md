# Chapter 2: Narrow vs General AI

**You’ll be able to:**
- Define **ANI** and **AGI**
- Explain the capability gap
- Identify real ANI around you; describe why AGI remains theoretical

## Key Ideas
- **ANI (today):** Specialized systems; superhuman in a **narrow** domain; cannot generalize outside scope.
  - Examples: chess engines, spam filters, smart speakers’ voice commands.
- **AGI (hypothetical):** Broad, human-level intelligence across many domains; reason/adapt to new tasks.
  - Status: does **not** exist today; debated timelines.

## Why it matters
- Sets realistic expectations; prevents overtrust.
- Guides deployment: use ANI where it’s strong; keep humans in the loop elsewhere.

## Review
- Define ANI vs AGI in your words.
- Give two ANI examples you use weekly.
- When is it **unsafe** to trust a narrow AI?

## Activity: Spot the Narrow AI
List 5 AI systems you see; for each, write the specific task, then label **ANI** or **AGI** (trick: all are ANI).
